# Social Network App
Social Network App is a Java-based application that allows users to create an account, make new friends and exchange messages.

## Description
Social Network App simulates the experience of a real-life social media application by letting a user create an account where they can manage friends, friendship requests, messages and so on.

Within the user screen menu, one can see all their friends. Here, they can also delete friends, accept or decline friendship requests or even send a new friendship request to a possible friend.

Once a friendship request has been sent to a new user, that said user will disappear from the options.
