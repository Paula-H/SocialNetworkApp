# Social Network App
Social Network App is a Java-based application that allows users to create an account, make new friends and exchange messages.

Within the user screen menu, one can see all their friends. Here, they can also delete friends, accept or decline friendship requests or even send a new friendship request to a possible friend.

Once a friendship request has been sent to a new user, that said user will disappear from the options.

The messages are received instantly by the other party.
